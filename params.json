{"name":"APO-DZ Name Formatter for Update Forms","tagline":"Webapp to format copied spreadsheet columns to Dean's Google Forms format.","body":"### About\r\nDean's Google Forms make updating the APO Spreadsheet absurdly easy, but they require names in the checkbox solution to be in a specific format:\r\n\r\n`Last Name; First Name`\r\n\r\nThus, when pledges are added or alumni are removed every semester, the Form needs to be updated with new names in this format. You can do this in about five seconds with any decent text editor with column select or regexp find/replace (e.g. [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)), but non-developers tend not to have that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nTry this instead.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n1. Copy the first two columns of the spreadsheet.\r\n2. Paste them in the box below.\r\n3. Click the Format button.\r\n4. Open the Google Form to update.\r\n5. Delete the name checkboxes.\r\n6. Select _all_ the formatted output below.\r\n7. In the now empty checkbox field, copy the formatted output.\r\n\r\nThat's it! Seven steps because seven is the most magical number in arithmancy.\r\n\r\n## Input\r\n\r\n\r\n## Output\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDean (@turniphead) made all the Google Forms and Apps Scripts for interacting with the APO Spreadsheet. Ronald (@ronaldsmartin) made this and the mobile stuff.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease email inquiries to developer@upennapo.org.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
